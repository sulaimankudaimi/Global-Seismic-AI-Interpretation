# 🌊 AI-Powered Global Seismic Interpretation
### Multi-Basin Generalization using Deep Learning
**By Sulaiman Kudaimi**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a high-performance **Deep Learning** model capable of interpreting seismic facies across different global basins. Originally trained on the **F3 North Sea dataset**, the model was successfully adapted to the **Zenodo cigFacies dataset** (Offshore China/Global) using advanced **Transfer Learning** techniques.



## 🚀 Key Features
* **Cross-Basin Generalization**: Model moves from structured layers (F3) to chaotic facies (Zenodo).
* **Fine-Tuning Optimization**: Rapid adaptation to new geological textures with minimal data.
* **End-to-End Pipeline**: From raw `.dat` and `.segy` processing to final AI-mapped skeletons.

## 📊 Results & Performance
The model shows significant improvement after the fine-tuning stage, successfully identifying structural features in complex chaotic classes.

| Dataset | Basin | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F3 Block** | North Sea, Netherlands | ✅ Fully Trained |
| **cigFacies** | Global/Zenodo | ✅ Adapted (Fine-tuned) |
